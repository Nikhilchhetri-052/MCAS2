pity the poor pigeon pigeon hold as it 
were rarely given its due Sunday morning's   newest contributor is bird watcher or 
birder Christian [Music] Cooper meet dinosaur the 17 ft tall 2-ton aluminum pigeon 
for the next year and a half its perch will be   New York City's High Line pigeons and birds 
as we know are what remains of dinosaurs so   what if we transform a pigeon and we bring it 
into a scale of a Tyrannosaur Rex artist Ivan   Argote showed us dinosaur as a work in progress 
maybe we're looking now what pigeons see from   us maybe we're now the pigeons and we're the 
ones running away and then they're like the   dominant ones I don't know what city you live in 
but pigeons don't run away in our city they like   come over says it's about time pigeons get the 
hero treatment dinosaur is like a very serious   proposition of what could be a monument that 
doesn't celebrate man a war Victory but that   celebrates a bird that's been with us since 
forever but the project like the bird itself   plays to mixed reviews people either love them 
or hate them but still it's a very iconic animal   of New York City and New York isn't the only 
city paying tribute to them earlier this year   the London Museum unveiled its controversial 
new logo why do you think so many people are   not too keen on pigeons my personal belief is 
they don't see them they don't watch them they   don't understand them Rita McMahon who founded 
the wild bird fund a rehab center for injured   wildlife in New York City they have their own 
world up there points to a put down from the   1960s when the city was in its most disrepair 
hoving who is the head of the parks department   he called pigeons flying rats rats with wings yes 
that's true and it's stuck that was terrible early   European settlers brought pigeons to America 
to breed his food some became feral and as we   built cities with tall buildings these natural 
cliff dwellers found themselves right at home   they like high places we're giving them Cliffs 
the Canyons of New York we are their Cliffs now during both world wars pigeons became valuable 
Partners thanks to their Visual acuity and homing   ability they were war heroes they received more 
Medals of Honor for saving lives than any other   animal and so this would be what a paratrooper 
would connect to their parachute they would   leap out of the plane come down to the ground and 
they had their pigeon to be able to send messages   McMahon says pigeons score off the charts on 
visual intelligence tests they can recognize words they can recognize when it's a garbage 
word those letters don't go together they know   landmarks they remember things they remember 
people and they're the main Wildlife that   people get to see if we can get people to look 
and understand pigeons it's their Gateway bird   to seeing nature more at New York's Wild Bird fund 
it's all right more than half of the 12,000 Birds   they receive each year are pigeons beautiful red 
coloration on these two some are just babies and   a handful unreleaseable into the wild get

Jones her pet parent says she's one spoiled pigeon she is like a house broken pet like 
she loves to like just lay around and preen   and watch TV I mean I'm not joking watch TV yes

taste yes refined taste Jones a high fashioned   photographer volunteers at the wild bird fund 
and takes pictures of their pigeons too in 2020   during Co he and his wife Jada fostered Ghob 
they never intended to become pigeon parents   but when they gave her back I know this sounds 
crazy but I noticed that she was looking sort   of sluggish in the cage and she seemed really 
depressed and like this bird is like not doing   well like by itself I said I'm taking go she's not 
doing well she's going to die there so like I took   her you're moved by this yeah your credit your 
humanity and Jada Humanity one out and now I'm   um I'm married with pigeons pigeons like Ghob can 
live around 15 years in the wild their lives are   substantially shorter they celebrated her fourth
